// ============================================================================
// Mutation keys for tracking in-flight mutations
//
// Benefits:
// - Track mutation state with useIsMutating
// - Implement optimistic updates with proper rollback
// - Deduplicate identical mutations
// - Coordinate related mutations
// ============================================================================

// Entity Mutation Keys

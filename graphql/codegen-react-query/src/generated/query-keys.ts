/**
 * Centralized query key factory
 * @generated by @constructive-io/graphql-codegen
 * DO NOT EDIT - changes will be overwritten
 */

// ============================================================================
// This file provides a centralized, type-safe query key factory following
// the lukemorales query-key-factory pattern for React Query.
//
// Benefits:
// - Single source of truth for all query keys
// - Type-safe key access with autocomplete
// - Hierarchical invalidation (invalidate all 'user.*' queries)
// - Scoped keys for parent-child relationships
// ============================================================================

// ============================================================================
// Entity Query Keys
